ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Thatguyjs

I'm a solo developer, with a focus in frontend / backend web dev, application development with Rust, and sometimes a little C or C++.

Some of my largest projects are: [Calculator-Ext](https://github.com/Thatguyjs/Calculator-Ext), [Calc-JS](https://github.com/Thatguyjs/Calc-JS), and [Christmas-Code](https://github.com/Thatguyjs/Christmas-Code).

I'm happy to help contribute to projects that need a bit of help or refactoring, especially if they're web-related or use Rust!
