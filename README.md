ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Thatguyjs

I'm (mainly) a solo developer, with a focus in frontend & backend Web Dev, application / game development with Rust, and sometimes a little C++.

Some of my favorite projects are [Calculator-Ext](https://github.com/Thatguyjs/Calculator-Ext), [Calc-JS](https://github.com/Thatguyjs/Calc-JS), and [Christmas-Code](https://github.com/Thatguyjs/Christmas-Code).

I'm happy to help contribute to any projects that need a bit of help or fixing up, especially if they're web-related or use Rust!
